# Welcome to Timothy Brown's Portfolio and Repository

## Intro
### Natural Language Processing (NPL) Projects <br>
**[Fake News Classification using Google's BERT- GitHub](https://github.com/brownt47/NLP_Projects/blob/main/BERT%20NLP%20Classification.md)**
Training a BERT model to classify fake news articles.  

### Tableau Portfolio <br>

**[Tableau Public Dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/profile/timothy.brown2096#!/)**

**[Course Enrollment Analysis - Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/timothy.brown2096#!/vizhome/AlpharettaProject/Story1)** <br>
Created a dashboard to show enrollment levels in various subjects, courses and campuses.  Can identify "low enrollment" classes with slider to adjust threshold level to be considered "low enrollment" course to measure impact of cancelling courses.



### VBA Projects <br>
**[Image Resizing and Hyperlink Insertion  in Word- GitHub](https://github.com/brownt47/VBA-Projects/blob/main/ResizeImage.md)**
This is a macro that will resize a selected image and attach a hyperlink to the image. It will also add the hyperlink as text below the image.

**[Course Enrollment Report Processing in Excel - GitHub](https://github.com/brownt47/VBA-Projects/blob/main/CrossListedCourses.md)** <br>
This is a VBA macro I wrote to address an issue with how enrollment reports displayed one course that had multiple cross-listings.  In order for one department to know how many students were enrolled in different courses, one would have to find all the cross-listed sections and then manually add them together.  This macro would automate that process across hundreds of cross-listed courses among all disciplines and campuses.

### PhotoShop Portfolio <br>
**[PhoroShop Porfolio - GitPages](https://brownt47.github.io/Photoshop/)** <br>
Collection of projects involving product placements, photo retouching, old photo restorations, object removals and some creative fun.
