## Other Projects <br>

#### Natural Language Processing (NPL) Projects <br>
* [Fake News Classification using Google's BERT- GitHub](https://github.com/brownt47/NLP_Projects/blob/main/BERT%20NLP%20Classification.md)
  * Training a BERT model to classify fake news articles.  

#### Scala and Spark Projects <br>
* [Processing Consumer Purchasing Data- GitHub](https://github.com/brownt47/Scala/blob/main/CustomerPurchasing.md)
  * Project was to total the combined purchases of each customer with a reduce function. Then sort the data by those totals. I added a challenge of finding those with spendatures greater than some predetermined amount.

#### VBA Projects <br>
* [Image Resizing and Hyperlink Insertion  in Word- GitHub](https://github.com/brownt47/VBA-Projects/blob/main/ResizeImage.md)
  * This is a macro that will resize a selected image and attach a hyperlink to the image. It will also add the hyperlink as text below the image.

* [Course Enrollment Report Processing in Excel - GitHub](https://github.com/brownt47/VBA-Projects/blob/main/CrossListedCourses.md) <br>
  * This is a VBA macro I wrote to address an issue with how enrollment reports displayed one course that had multiple cross-listings.  In order for one department to know how many students were enrolled in different courses, one would have to find all the cross-listed sections and then manually add them together.  This macro would automate that process across hundreds of cross-listed courses among all disciplines and campuses.

#### R Projects

* [Solutions for "R for Data Science" by Hadley Wickham](https://brownt47.github.io/R-For-Data-Science-Solutions)<br>
  * Some of the other solution guides for the book used R structures and methods not introduced in this text.  I wanted to write a solution manual that assumes no previous R experience and only uses methods described in the book.  Still a passion project in progress.

#### Interesting Research and Publications 
* [How to Read a Paper - S. Keshav (pdf)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) <br>
  * *A research paper on how to read research papers.  Truly a standout in the field of meta.*
